# blackjack
A very simple simulation of the card game of black jack. 
Using the values ranging from 1-10 instead of the actual cards themselves. 
First version only allows a single user. 
Will be modified to allow multiple players to join (max up to 6 players). 
Will be updating to implement the actual deck itself instead of simply using the values.
