# blackjack
A very simple simulation of the card game of black jack. 
Using the values ranging from 1-11 instead of the actual cards themselves. 
blackJack.java only allows a single user. 
multiPlayerBlackJack.java allows for up to 6 players.
  -- Still contains some bugs:
      -- Does not call bust when player is handed two cards of value > 21 initially 
      -- Does not declare black jack when player is handed two cards of value == 21 initially 
      -- Does not yet take into consideration the results when two players have the same highest value after dealer has bust            or lost 
Will be updating to implement the actual deck itself instead of simply using the values.
