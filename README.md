# BlackJack Simulation

A simple simulation of the card game, BlackJack. 

## Information

It uses values ranging from 1-11 to represent the deck. 
blackJack.java is a simulation for a singler player vs. the dealer
multiPlayerBlackJack.java allows for up to a 6 player simulation vs. the dealer.

### Work in Progress

Still contains a couple bugs:
	* -- Does not call "bust" when player is handed two cards of value > 21 initially. 
	* -- Does not declare "BlackJack" when player is handed two cards of value == 21 initially. 
	* -- Does not yet take into consideration when two players have the same highest value after dealer has bust or lost. 

Will be updating soon to fix these bugs. 
Will be updating soon to implement the actual deck itself instead of simply using values. 
Will also be looking into adjusting the simulation to become a playable version, with the ability to "bet.""
